# How Fondok calculates — methodology overview

This is the analyst-facing methodology cheat sheet. It explains where
each number on the Operating Statement / Investment / Returns tab comes
from and which source wins when multiple are available.

## Operating-ratio precedence chain (Wave 2 P2.7)

Sam's June 2026 ask: "Wants op-ratios extracted from CBRE / in-house
portfolio P&Ls (not HOST defaults)." Generic HostStats defaults were
killing credibility with institutional analysts who already have their
OWN portfolio data. Fondok now resolves operating-expense ratios
(rooms-dept %, F&B-dept %, admin %, sales %, utilities %, etc.) using
the following precedence chain, highest to lowest:

1. **Analyst override** — explicit, with a justification note. Set via
   the OverridePanel on any P&L row. Final say.
2. **T-12 actual** — Year-1 actual from the subject hotel's own
   extracted T-12. The most credible Y1 anchor we have.
3. **In-house portfolio P&L benchmark** (new) — the analyst firm's own
   roll-up of ratios across hotels they already operate. Most credible
   peer set when it covers the subject chain scale.
4. **CBRE Horizons benchmark** (new) — chain-scale-segmented industry
   benchmark from a CBRE Hotel Horizons report. Skipped when the
   chain scale doesn't match the subject deal — falls through to the
   next-lower tier instead of applying a mismatched benchmark.
5. **HostStats / generic industry default** (formerly the only
   external source) — applied when no portfolio / CBRE candidate
   covers the field. Tagged `pnl_benchmark` on the UI badge.
6. **Kimpton seed default** — absolute fallback. Keeps the engine
   from crashing when no real data is available; analysts see a
   "Seed" badge so they know it's not grounded.

Out-years are always grown forward from the chosen Year-1 anchor at
the configured `expense_growth` rate (default 3.5%) regardless of which
tier supplied the Y1 number.

### Worked example

200-key Marriott Courtyard, T-12 shows 12% rooms-dept ratio, CBRE
Horizons says 14% for that chain scale, portfolio P&L says 11%,
analyst override blank.

| Tier | Available? | Value | Winner? |
|---|---|---|---|
| analyst_override | ✗ | — | — |
| t12_actual | ✓ | 12% | **YES** |
| portfolio_pnl | ✓ | 11% | (outranked) |
| cbre_horizons | ✓ | 14% | (outranked) |
| pnl_benchmark | (seed) | 13% | (outranked) |
| seed | ✓ | 30% | (outranked) |

→ Engine output uses **12%** with source label `t12_actual`. The
Operating Statement renders the row with a green "T-12" badge so the
reviewer can see at a glance the value is grounded in real data.

### Why this order

* **Override beats everything** because the analyst's intent is final;
  the IC sometimes hard-codes a number for partnership / underwriting
  reasons even when actuals disagree.
* **T-12 beats every benchmark** — when we know what the hotel
  actually spent, that's the most credible Y1 anchor full stop.
* **Portfolio P&L beats CBRE** because the firm OWNS the underlying
  P&Ls; CBRE's roll-up is a black box of third-party reports.
* **CBRE beats HostStats default** because CBRE is segmented by chain
  scale + submarket; HostStats is one-size-fits-all.
* **Seed is the absolute fallback** so the engine never crashes.

### Chain-scale matching for CBRE Horizons

When the subject deal carries a chain-scale tag (e.g. "Upper Upscale")
and the CBRE candidate doesn't match (e.g. "Lower Priced"), the
resolver SKIPS the CBRE candidate and falls through to the next-lower
tier (HostStats → seed). A debug log records the fall-through so
analysts can trace it on the Engine Run page. Mismatched benchmarks
are worse than no benchmark.

### Where to look in code

* `apps/worker/app/services/op_ratio_precedence.py` — pure resolver
  (no DB / no engine import), unit-tested in
  `apps/worker/tests/test_op_ratio_precedence.py`.
* `apps/worker/app/services/engine_runner.py` — `_load_engine_inputs`
  builds the per-ratio candidates dict and calls `resolve_ratio` /
  `resolve_all` to compute the winning source per field, then writes
  the winning value into `base["overrides"]` and the winning source
  into `base["__sources__"]`.
* `apps/worker/app/agents/extraction_schemas/portfolio_pnl.md` — the
  Extractor schema for the new `PORTFOLIO_PNL` doc type.
* `apps/web/src/components/help/AssumptionBadge.tsx` — UI badge
  rendering for each source label (T-12, Portfolio, CBRE, PNL Bench,
  Seed, Override).
* `apps/web/src/components/project/PLTab.tsx` — Operating Statement
  with per-row source badges and the "Precedence" coachmark.
